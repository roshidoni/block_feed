3. Enable **Developer mode** in the top-right corner.

## Features

- Blocks youtube feed in weekdays (Monday to Friday)
- Blocks web.telegram.org 's channels in weekdays (Monday to Friday)

> **Note:** I have paused new feature development for this Chrome extension and am focusing on updating the Firefox version, since I primarily use Firefox-based browsers now. You can still tweak the chrome extension
